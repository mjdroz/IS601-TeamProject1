* **Background Information**

	* Continuous integration, sometimes referred to as CI, is the process of integrating code changes from multiple developers into a single product using automation.
	* Continuous integration relies heavily on version control systems, like Git, to be able to work properly and effectively.
	* Version control systems can sometimes work in tandem with other systems like syntax review tools, code quality tests, and mu
ch more.
	* Without continuous integration developers must commmunicate exactly what they are contributing to the final product. How with continuous integration every change is noted and coordination becomes less of a hassle.

* **Productivity**

	* Continuous integration can help imrpove the productivity of a company be enabling multiple developers to edit and change cod
e for a single software product. This in turn can lead to problems being solved faster and more effectively.
	* On the surface continuous integration does sound like it can cause issues, especailly if one developers code does not work w
hen paired with his or her partners code. However, continuous integration relies heavily on version control systems, which would allow
 the project manager or developers to rollback the changes made before pushing out the product.
	* With the ability to have more people working on the same software project, companies who use continuous integration will see
 an increase in product output and products that have problems throughout development.
	* Companies using continuous integration can also increase headcount on development teams because developers would be able to work parallel with each on multiple different issues that they need to tackle.


* **Competitiveness**

	* Continuous integration gives companies a competitive edge by allowing their developers to work in a more coordinated manner in which development issues can be resolved faster and products can be pushed out sooner.
	* Without coninuous integration companies run the risk of having a disconnect between the developers and project managers at the companies. Continuous integration allows for better communication and coordination channels that can be used by developers and those above them.
