# Basics of Git Repositories

* **Definition**

	* Repositories in Git are used to contain a collection of files used for a project. These files can have multiple versions saved within the repository
	* Repositories are stored seperate from a developers local machine, however, as developer can fork an existing repository and clone a repository to his or her local mahcine in order to work on files in that repository. Once finished working, the developer can push the changes back to the forked repository, and from there the developer can then create a pull request with the original repository in order to commit changes to "main" project at hand
	* There are two types of repositories:
        	* **Bare Repositories:** These are used by multiple developers who are looking to collaborate on project and want share their individual changes.
        	* **Non-bare Repositories:** These are user friendly and allow for a user to make new versions of files and modifications to files. When you clone a repository, it becomes a non-bare repository by default.

* **Examples and Uses**

	* Repositories allow developers to add new files, commiting changes to files, deleting repositories, and much more!
	* They are an extremely useful tool for development teams with a large geographical spread. In other words, development teams with member spread out around the globe will likely not be coding at the same time, and definitely not all in the same place. Repositories can help keep the project going without having to eamil over files constantly. The repository will allow developers to clone the newest working copy to their local machines to begin working on whatever they plan to do.
