# Basics of Forking in Git

![Diagram of How Forking Works](https://svalinn.github.io/DAGMC/_images/workflow.png)

* **Definition**

	* Forking a repository in Git works similar to the "copy and paste" functionality that all computers have. When you fork a repository, you are creating an exact copy of that repository for you to experiment with.
	* As just mentioned, the forked version of the repository is yours to do whatever with, and therefore any changes that you make will only effect the forked repository.
	* If someone wanted to make changes and then add them to the repository that they forked, they would need to send a pull request to the repository owner to merge. This can allow for developers to get outside help from people who are not directly involved in the project, but would like to help solve issues or make things simpler.

* **Examples and Uses**
	* Forking with Git allows for developers to make changes to a project without running the risk of causing issues.
	* Forking allows for community projects where amateur or even professional developers can contribute towards projects where they see fit. This allows project managers to ask the software development for help when their team runs into an issue that they are having trouble solving. It never hurts to get a spare set of eyes on your code!
	* Forking allows developers or even comapnies to use publicly available repositories for reference on projects that they may be working on as well.
