* **Background Information**

	* Git is a version control system that helps in maintaining the integrity of files while also allowing the developers to work quickly.
	* Git allows multiple developers to work on the same document at the same time. This is done through forking and cloning of repositories to local machines.The developers work on their local machines and then "push" changes to the main repository. A project manager will assemble the changes that the developers make using pull requests.
	* Git is a fantastic solution to version control issues, and many companies around the world use it today.

* **Productivity**

	* Git allows multiple developers to work on the same file from anywhere in the world and at any time of day. This in turn allows more goals to be met and more problems to be fixed during a work day. Companies, especially large ones, cannot afford to have developers work on a file one at a time.
	* Git alleviates this issue by enabling multiple developers to fork and clone the project onto there local machines. This enables all developers on a development team to be able to work on and fix a single file at the same time. With this in mind, problems are solved faster and goals are constantly met.

* **Competitiveness**

	* Git gives a company a competitive edge by allowing the company to push out development projects and software at a quicker rate.
	* Along with the decrease in development time, Git allows companies to make quick and seamless changes to products. In the unfortunate case that a change caused more issues than it fixed, Git allows developers to roll back to the original version without having to completely scrap the newly broken one.
	* Version control systems, like Git, give companies the ability to work at quicker rates, alleviate development issues that come from bug fixes and patches, and expand their workforce into the global market, since the development team does not necessarily have to be in the same time zone or building while working on the project.
